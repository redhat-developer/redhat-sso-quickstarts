app-profile-saml-jee-jsp: HTML5 Profile Application with SAML
=============================================================

Level: Beginner
Technologies: JavaEE
Summary: JSP Profile Application
Target Product: Red Hat SSO, JBoss EAP
Source: <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts>


What is it?
-----------

The `app-profile-saml-jee-jsp` quickstart demonstrates how to write an application with JavaEE that
authenticates using Red Hat SSO over the SAML protocol. Once authenticated the application shows the users profile information.


System Requirements
-------------------

If you are deploying the application as a WAR you need to have JBoss EAP 7.1.0 running.

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.1.1 or later.


Configuration in Red Hat SSO
-----------------------

Prior to running the quickstart you need to create a client in Red Hat SSO and download the installation file.

The following steps shows how to create the client required for this quickstart:

* Open the Red Hat SSO admin console
* Select `Clients` from the menu
* Click `Create`
* Add the following values:
  * Client ID: You choose (for example `app-profile-saml`)
  * Client Protocol: `saml`
* Click `Save`

Once saved you need to change the following values:

* Valid Redirect URIs: `http://localhost:8080/app-profile-saml/*`
* Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/app-profile-saml/`
* Master SAML Processing URL: `http://localhost:8080/app-profile-saml/saml`
* Force Name ID Format: `ON`

If you deploy the application somewhere else change the hostname and port of the URLs accordingly.

To be able to retrieve the profile details next click on `Mappers`. Then click on `Add Builtin` and select all the
mappers before clicking `Add selected`.

Finally you need to configure the adapter, this is done by retrieving the adapter configuration file:

* Click on `Installation` in the tab for the client you created
* Select `Keycloak SAML Adapter keycloak-saml.xml`
* Click `Download`
* Edit `keycloak-saml.xml` and replace `SPECIFY YOUR LOGOUT PAGE!` with `/index.jsp`
* Move the file `keycloak-saml.xml` to the `config/` directory in the root of the quickstart

As an alternative you can create the client by importing the file [client-import.json](config/client-import.json) and
copying [config/keycloak-saml-example.xml](config/keycloak-saml-example.xml) to `config/keycloak-saml.xml`. Finally,
you need to edit `config/keycloak-saml.xml` and replace `REPLACE WITH REALM CERTIFICATE` with the actual realm certificate.
You can retrieve the realm certificate from the admin console from `Keys` under `Realm Settings`.


Build and Deploy the Quickstart
--------------------------------

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.

2. The following shows the command to deploy the quickstart:

   ````
   mvn clean wildfly:deploy
   ````

If you prefer to secure WARs via Red Hat SSO SAML subsystem:

   ````
   mvn install -Dsubsystem wildfly:deploy

   ````

Access the Quickstart
----------------------

You can access the application with the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/app-profile-saml>


Undeploy the Quickstart
--------------------

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.

2. The following shows the command to undeploy the quickstart:

````
mvn install wildfly:undeploy
````
