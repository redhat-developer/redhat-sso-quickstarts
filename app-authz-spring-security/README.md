What is it?
-----------

The `app-authz-spring-security` quickstart demonstrates how to write a Spring Security application where both authentication and
authorization aspects are managed by Red Hat SSO.

This application tries to focus on the authorization features provided by Red Hat SSO Authorization Services, where resources are
protected by a set of permissions and policies defined in Keycloak itself and access to these resources are enforced by a policy enforcer
that intercepts every single request to the application.

In this application, there are three paths protected by specific permissions in Red Hat SSO:

* **/protected**, where access to this page is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource **Protected Resource** in Red Hat SSO. Basically,
any user with a role *user* is allowed to access this page.

* **/protected/premium**, where access to this page is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource **Premium Resource** in Red Hat SSO. Basically,
only users with a role *user-premium* is allowed to access this page.

* **/protected/alice**, where access to this page is based on the evaluation of permissions associated with a resource **Alice Resource** in Red Hat SSO. Basically,
only user *alice* is allowed to access this page.

The home page (home.ftl) also demonstrates how to use a ``AuthorizationContext`` instance to check for user's permissions and hide/show
things in a page. Where the ``AuthorizationContext`` encapsulates all permissions granted by a Red Hat SSO server and provides methods
to check these permissions.

You can use two distinct users to access this application:

|Username|Password|Roles|
|---|---|---|
|alice|alice|user|
|jdoe|jdoe|user, user-premium|


System Requirements
-------------------

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.1.1 or later.


Configuration in Red Hat SSO
-----------------------

Prior to running the quickstart you need to create a `realm` in Red Hat SSO with all the necessary configuration to deploy and run the quickstart.

To create the realm required for this quickstart, follow these steps:

1. Open the Red Hat SSO admin console
2. In the top left corner dropdown menu that is titled `Master`, click `Add Realm`. If you are logged in to the master realm this dropdown menu lists all the realms created.
3. For this quickstart we are not going to manually create the realm, but import all configuration from a JSON file. Click on `Select File` and import the [config/realm-import.json](config/realm-import.json).
4. Click `Create`

The steps above will result on a new `spring-security-quickstart` realm.

Build and Run the Quickstart
-------------------------------

Make sure your Red Hat SSO server is running on <http://localhost:8180/>. For that, you can start the server using the command below:

   ````
   cd {KEYCLOAK_HOME}/bin
   ./standalone.sh -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=100
   
   ````

If your server is up and running, perform the following steps to start the application:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.

2. The following shows the command to deploy the quickstart:

   ````
   mvn spring-boot:run

   ````

Access the Quickstart
---------------------

You can access the application with the following URL: <http://localhost:8080/>.

Integration test of the Quickstart
----------------------------------

1. Make sure you have an Red Hat SSO server running with an admin user in the `master` realm or use the provided docker image
2. Be sure to set the `TestHelper.keycloakBaseUrl` in the `createArchive` method (default URL is localhost:8180/auth).
3. Set accordingly the correct url for the `keycloak.auth-server-url` in the test [application.properties](src/test/resources/application.properties).
4. Run `mvn test -Pspring-boot`
